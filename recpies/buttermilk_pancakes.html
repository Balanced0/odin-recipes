    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A very light and fluffy pancake recipe that requires fresh buttermilk.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Flour:</b> All-purpose flour contains gluten, which gives the buttermilk pancakes structure and pleasant chewiness.</li>
        <li><b>Sugar:</b> Just three tablespoons ofwhite sugar should be enough to lend subtle sweetness. Remember,<br> you'll be adding a lot more sugar if you top the pancakes with syrup or molasses!</li>
        <li><b>Leaveners:</b> Baking powder and baking soda act as leaveners<br> (a substance that releases gas when mixed with other ingredients, causing the batter to rise to fluffy perfection).</li>
        <li><b>Salt:</b> You definitely don't want to skip adding a small amount of salt â€” the buttermilk pancakes will taste bland without it.</li>
        <li><b>Buttermilk:</b> Of course, you'll need buttermilk for buttermilk pancakes! This recipe calls for three whole cups.</li>
        <li><b>Milk:</b> Wholemilk helps create the perfect batter consistency and cuts some of the buttermilk's acidity.</li>
        <li><b>Eggs:</b> Three whole eggs add structure and rich flavor to the buttermilk pancakes.</li>
        <li><b>Butter:</b> Melted butter lends flavor and keeps the pancakes nice and moist.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.<br> Beat buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.</p></li>
        <li><p>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready.</p></li>
        <li><p>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork to mix until it's just blended together.<br> The batter will be a little lumpy which is what you want.</p></li>
        <li><p>Pour or scoop batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes;<br> flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</p></li>
        <li><p>Serve hot and enjoy!</p></li>
    </ol>
